#All one needs to know about lists and how to use them!

mylist = ["blueberry", "cherry", "strawberry"]
print(mylist)

mylist2 = list()
print(mylist2) #It creates another bracket below when you print it.

mylist3 = ["apple", 3, False, "Maxime Bournez"]
print(mylist3)

item = mylist3[1]
print(item)

#It is possible to use a loop to refer to all the items in a list.

for x in mylist3:
    print(x) #x makes it possible, we could also use other letters.

if "banana" in mylist: #Check if your index is in the list
    print("Yes, there's one.")
else:
    print("No man, no bananas.") #It works fine.

print("xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

#What other methods to use with lists?

#Check all the elements quite fast
print(len(mylist))

#Add one element to the list
mylist.append("john cena")
print(mylist)

#Insert an element somewhere in the list
mylist.insert(1, "paul chesneau")
print(mylist)

#Remove an element somewhere in the list
mylist.pop
